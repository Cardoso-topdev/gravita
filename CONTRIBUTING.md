## INSTRUCTIONS 

Develop is a primary branch we will work from. Main branch will contain a gold copy and will be periodically updated from develop branch. 

### Create a new branch off of develop branch. Please follow the tips below 

- create a new branch using  Feature/ Task/ Fix/ Refactor/ naming convention 
- when committing changes use feat: task: fix: refactor: commit naming convention
- create a PR against the develop branch, **not main branch**
- assign one of the available engineers as a reviewer
- wait for review to complete and approval before merging 
- ensure to resolve all comments before merging
- address reviewer comments and apply refactors where applicable before merging
